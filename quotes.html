            </li>

            <li>"I am not who you think I am. I am not who I think I am. I am who I think you think I am." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Charles Horton Cooley</span>
            </li>

            <li>"We don't even know what our desire is. We ask other people to tell us our desires." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- René Girard</span>
            </li>

            <li>"There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind,
                you are the one who hears it." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Michael A. Singer, "The Untethered Soul"</span>
            </li>

            <li>"I've been thinking. Tomorrow it will be twenty-eight years to the day that I've been in the service.
                Twenty-eight years in peace and war. I don't suppose I've been at home more than ten months in all that
                time. Still, it's been a good life. I loved India. I wouldn't have had it any other way. But there are
                times when suddenly you realize you're nearer the end than the beginning. And you wonder, you ask
                yourself, what the sum total of your life represents. What difference your being there at any time made
                to anything. Hardly made any difference at all, really, particularly in comparison with other men's
                careers. I don't know whether that kind of thinking's very healthy; but I must admit I've had some
                thoughts on those lines from time to time. But tonight... tonight!" <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Colonel Nicholsen, "The Bridge on the River Kwai"</span>

            <h2>On Others...</h2>


            <li>"Empathy is not the truth — it's not the reality — it's the other side's point of view." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Chris Voss, "MasterClass 0.3. Labeling"</span>
            </li>

            <li>"Whenever you are observing an entity from the outside and they are apparently engaged in crazy or
                irrational behavior, it's rarely because the entity is actually irrational. It's usually because you are
                lacking some information about the internal mechanisms of what’s going on." <br>

                </span>
            </li>

            <li>"... when you look directly at an insane man all you see is a reflection of your own knowledge that he’s
                insane, which is not to see him at all." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Robert M. Pirsig, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"</span>
            </li>

            <li>"Those on the fringes are often the harbingers of what is to come." <br>

                </span>
            </li>

            <li>"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but
                rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it... An
                important scientific innovation rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its
                opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually
                die out, and that the growing generation is familiarized with the ideas from the beginning." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Max Planck, "Scientific Autobiography and Other Papers", p. 33</span>
            </li>

            <li>"If people are saying bad things about you, you don't have to defend it. Because your friends will know
                it's not true, and the people that don't like you, they're not going to believe it when you do defend
                yourself anyway, so just don't engage." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Destin Sandlin, <a href="https://youtu.be/NoDumbQuestionsEpisode7" target="_blank">"No Dumb Questions Episode 7: 007

            <li>"As long as some minds remain a mystery, so too will all minds." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Michael Stevens, <a href="https://youtu.be/wcPzTr-BbAA" target="_blank">"Divergent Minds - Mind Field S2 (Ep 7)"</a>
                </span>
            </li>

            <li>"If there's one person around you who makes you feel defensive, you lose the confidence to play and it's
                good-bye creativity. So always make sure your play friends are people you like and trust. And never say
                anything to squash them either. Never say 'no' they're wrong or 'I don't like that'. Always be positive
                and build on what's been said." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- John Cleese,  <a href="https://youtu.be/5xPvvPTQaMI" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/5xPvvPTQaMI</a>

            </li>

            <li>"Be an improviser and change the world: make a connection, listen, say 'yes, and...', be in the moment,
                stay flexible, avoid preconceived ideas, respect other people's choices, listen to your inner voice, and
                follow your intuition." <br>

            <li>"The philosopher's school, ye men, is a surgery: you ought not to go out of it with pleasure, but with
                pain. For you are not in sound health when you enter." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Epictetus, "The Discourses"</span>
            </li>

            <li>"When we don't know how the things are working, we call it magic... once we know how it is working, it
                becomes a technique." <br>

            </li>

            <li>"The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of
                generality." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- David Hilbert</span>
            </li>

            <li>"In math, you should always be happy to play with examples that are idealized, potentially well beyond
                the point of being realistic, because they can offer a good first step in the direction of something
                more general, and hence, more realistic." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Grant Sanderson,  <a href="https://youtu.be/ToIXSwZ1pJU?t=188" target="_blank">"Solving the heat equation |

                </span>
            </li>

            <li>"Confirmation bias is when your brain ignores evidence that doesn't support your beliefs, and then it
                cherry picks the evidence that does... If you assume good intentions on the part of your friends and
                family, and you tell yourself you're lucky to have them... Studies have shown that the best predictor of
                divorce is if the couple assumes bad intentions in their partner's actions... if you get it in your head
                that your partner is selfish or inconsiderate or willfully refusing to take out the garbage, that
                creates a negative feedback loop of confirmation bias, seeking to find further evidence that your spouse
                is a jerk, even when good faith efforts are being made." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Mark Rober, <a href="https://youtu.be/1UTjWy-vnOo?t=857" target="_blank">"I Gave the MIT Commencement

            </li>

            <li>"He told me to close my eyes and find a plane based on how it feels. He asked me to make a slight right
                turn while keeping my eyes closed. I did so, and after the turn I thought I was flying level, but I had
                inadvertently tipped the plane into a graveyard spiral... How you feel is not necessarily how it is. In
                fact, going by feel without having an idea of where you are in the scheme of things will often get you
                into very big trouble in life as well as in aviation." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- Craig Ferguson, "Riding The Elephant by Craig Ferguson", p. 180</span>
            </li>

            <li>"...a very fundamental part of my soul is to doubt and to ask... I have approximate answers and possible
                beliefs and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I'm not absolutely sure of
                anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask
                why we're here... I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being
                lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell."
                <br>

            <li>"What you see and what you hear depends a great deal on where you are standing. It also depends on what
                sort of person you are." <br>
                <span style="padding-left: 20px;">- C.S. Lewis, "The Magician’s Nephew"</span>

            </li>

            <li>"What I cannot create, I do not understand." <br>

            </li>

            <li>"... there is one feature I notice that is generally missing in Cargo Cult Science. That is the idea
                that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school—we never explicitly say what this is,
                but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting,
                therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly. It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a
                principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty—a kind of leaning over
                backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might
                make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your
                results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they
                worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated. Details that could throw doubt
                on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can—if you know
                anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong—to explain it." <br>

            </li>

            <li>"...that part of formal scientific method called experimentation, is sometimes thought of by romantics
                as all of science itself because that’s the only part with much visual surface. They do not see the
                experiment as part of a larger intellectual process and so they often confuse experiments with
                demonstrations, which look the same. A man conducting a gee-whiz science show with fifty thousand
                dollars’ worth of Frankenstein equipment is not doing anything scientific if he knows beforehand what
                the results of his efforts are going to be." <br>

            </li>

            <li>"In addition to the uncertainties that we must deal with in astronomy as a consequence of the limited
                accuracy of our equipment, and also to limits in available observation time, there are the astronomers'
                nightmares: the 'unknown-hidden' uncertainties. Is there perhaps an error you are making that you don't
                even know about because you're missing something, or because your instruments are calibrated
                incorrectly?... We call that a systematic error, and it scares the hell out of us." <br>

            <li>"You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting
                that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it’s going to rise tomorrow. When people are
                fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it’s
                always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt." <br>

            <li>"The apparent collapse of the wavefunction is indeed a profound mystery — should we then be surprised
                that one response is to build invisible universes to compensate?...
                <br>These makeshift repairs and
                inventions are needed if science is not to be derailed or demoralized by its lacunae... These might turn
                out to be entirely the wrong concepts, but they make our ignorance concrete and enable us to think about
                how to explore it." <br>
