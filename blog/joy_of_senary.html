					<h3>How it happened</h3>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 0px;">
						Why base 6? To make a long story short, it's easy to count to high numbers, and it's good for 
						calculating RPMs. <br>

						Walking to a college class at the Allison Road Classroms (ARC), probably to a generic class
						like general chemistry, I don't remember. 
						<br>

						I was tired an delirious and started counting my steps in my head: "one," "two," "three,"... At some point, 
						I was walking faster than I could count because the numbers were multisyllabic
						and was starting to forget what number I was on. 
						<br>
						
						So I decided I would offload some of this effort onto the only convenient placeholders I had: my fingers. 
						I forgot what number I was on and started over. 
						<br>

						I counted ten steps and got lazy, so on my left hand I used 1 finger to represent those ten 
						and started counting aloud at 1 again. I repeated this until I had all 5 fingers up on my left hand.* 
						I had counted to ten, but run out of fingers on my left hand. So on the next 
						restart, I raised 1 finger on my right hand and closed my fingers on my left hand. 
						(Note, when raising fingers one at a time starting from my thumb, I struggle once I reach ring/pinky fingers.
						So now I start with my pinky.)
						<br><br>



						*Initially, I wasn't paying attenting to detail, and when my 5th finger was raised, 
						I immediately closed my left hand and carried the one over to my right hand. As opposed
						to when my fifth finger is raised AND I count to 10 aloud again. 
						This error led me to be counting in base 5 on my left hand. 
						<br><br>

						Base 6 allows me to count quickly and record accurately.<br> 
						With a stopwatch, this is especially good for counting RPM.<br> 
						Once your watch hits 60 seconds, stop counting.<br> 
						Take your number in base 6 and divide by 60 seconds.<br> 
						What is 60? Well, it factors into 6*10. We can divide our number
						by these two factors one at a time.<br> 
						So take your base-6 number and divide by 6; that is, move the decimial point to the left one place.<br> 
						The base-6 number is now an order of magnitude smaller, and therefore slightly easier to work with.<br> 
						Now convert this smaller number to base 10. Multiply by the 1/6ths place, 6ths place, and the 36ths place
						and sum them.<br> 
						Take the new base-10 number and divide by 10, the second factor. That is, move the decimal point
						to the left one place (again).<br> 

						One place value is auditory.<br> 
						The second is your left hand. <br>
						The third is your right hand. <br>
						The fourth is a number you imagine in your head. <br>


						You have now almost mindlessly calculated an RPM with up to 4 significant figures of precision
						with nothing but a minute and a stopwatch. <br>

						You can just truncate after the decimal if you don't want the precision. 


						Why don't we count in base 11?
